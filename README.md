# Showcase

## The reason for this repository

This repository is created to showcase different programming languages by implementing an 'expenses' project.
Each implementation is different from one another. For each implementation there should exist separate README file.

### Why expenses project and what does it mean

I wanted to have a program that allowed me to track my expenses. Over time my needs, skills and ideas changed, which resulted in different implementations of expenses project. In the end, I've decided to think of my expenses projects as showcases and references to different programming languages. This has several benefits:

* I can use this repository as a portfolio; 
* I or someone else can reference and/or look up some solutions/ideas/syntax, if there is any need. 

In the future I'm planning on adding implementations of expenses project in different programming languages. Furthermore, I'll be adding different kind of projects to this repository. For example 'Simple csv parser in Haskell' or simple Monte-Carlo method implementations in different languages.

### List of current projects

#### Expenses

* Python + SQL (py_sql) - this project is old, incomplete and abandoned, but showcases some python and sql (althought the code is not the most elegant).
* Python (py) -  this project was written to be simple script that can be ran on the commandline either in computer or mobile device.
* R + shiny (rshiny) - this project was written to be a graphical solution to expenses project, that allows to manage and visualize expenses interactively in a GUI.
* C++ (cpp) - this project was written as a project in C++ course and is meant to be run in a GNU/Linux commandline. This program semi interactive.
* Haskell (hs) - this project was written to learn Haskell. This is an interactive CLI implementation of expenses project.

#### Monte-Carlo

* Haskell - This project was made to show the parallel aspects of Haskell. Also, it was submitted as a homework in parallel computation course. The Monte-Carlo method was used as an example, since MC method is embarrasingly parallel. In this project it was not achieved. Furthermore, the Haskell implementation can be improved upon.
* R - This project is to test and explore serial and parallel computations in R. Monte-Carlo method is used, since it is easily parallelized.

#### Other

* Simple csv parser in haskell - When compiled, takes a filepath and parses the contents to a matrix, where each matrix row corresponds to row in a file. Each comma separated item is it's own item inside the row list.
* FizzBuzz - Implementations of fizzbuzz in different languages. Tried to make them bit more efficient, than the most simple solution. However, I haven't benchmarked them.
