# Showcase

## The reason for this repository

This repository is created to showcase different programming languages by implementing an 'expenses' project.
Each implementation is different from one another. For each implementation there should exist separate README file.

### Why expenses project and what does it mean

I wanted to have a program that allowed me to track my expenses. Over time my needs, skills and ideas changed, which resulted in different implementations of expenses project. In the end, I've decided to think of my expenses projects as showcases and references to different programming languages. This means I can add this repository to my CV; I or someone else can reference and look up some solutions/ideas/syntax, if there is any need. In the future I'm planning on adding implementations of expenses project in different programming languages, first in line is Haskell.

### List of current projects

#### Expenses

	* Python + SQL (py_sql) - this project is old, incomplete and abandoned, but showcases some python and sql (althought the code is not the most elegant).
	* Python (py) -  this project was written to be simple script that can be ran on the commandline either in computer or mobile device.
	* R + shiny (rshiny) - this project was written to be a graphical solution to expenses project, that allows interactive expenses adding and reporting. This solution is in progress and is not yet complete (adding expenses is mostly complete, CURRENTLY MAY BREAK DUE TO SOME FUNCTIONALITY NOT COMPLETE).
	* C++ (cpp) - this project was written as a project in C++ course and is meant to be run in a GNU/Linux commandline.
	* Haskell (hs) - this project is written so I could learn haskell. Currently at a very early stage.

#### Other

	* Simple csv parser in haskell - Currently takes a file in string format and parses the contents to a matrix, where each matrix row corresponds to row in a file. Each comma separated item is it's own item inside the row list.
